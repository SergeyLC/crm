If you're currently using any of these guides:

1. **Traditional PM2 Deployment** → Migrate to [Manual Build Docker Deployment](../03-production-manual-build.md)
2. **Old Docker Setup** → Use [new Docker guides](../README.md)
3. **Legacy Staging** → Follow [new Staging Guide](../04-staging-deployment.md)
4. **Old CI/CD** → Update to [GitHub Actions Guide](../02-production-github-actions.md)

## 📅 Archive Date

**Archived**: December 20, 2025  
**Reason**: Documentation restructuring and modernization  
**Replacement**: Modular English-only Docker-based guides

## 💡 Why These Were Archived

1. **Fragmentation** - Too many overlapping guides
2. **Mixed Languages** - English and German mixed in same repository
3. **Outdated Methods** - PM2/manual deployment superseded by Docker
4. **Poor Navigation** - Hard to find the right guide
5. **Maintenance Burden** - Multiple guides describing same processes

## ✅ What Replaced Them

The new documentation structure offers:
- **7 focused guides** instead of 14+ fragmented files
- **All in English** for consistency
- **Docker-first** approach (industry standard)
- **Clear navigation** with cross-links
- **Step-by-step instructions** with troubleshooting
- **Production AND Staging** in dedicated guides
